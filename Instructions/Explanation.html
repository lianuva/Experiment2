  On the next page you will see the scores of two participants on two tasks, a mathematical task and a verbal task.
  These tasks are played twice by several participants. You will also be faced with some demographics of the participants. 
  Hover your mouse over the buttons to reveal the information you want to know. The tasks were as follows:
  <br><br>

  <u>Mathematical task</u><br>
  Participants were faced with a matrix of 12 numbers. They had to find which numbers summed up to 10. 
  When they were correct, they saw the next matrix. This looked like this:
  <br>
  <img src="{{ static 'Instructions/math_task.png' }}" class="left" width="30%" height="auto"/>

  <br><br>
  Score: the maximum score participants get on this task is 10, the minimum is 0. 


  <br><br>
  <u>Verbal task</u><br>
  For this task, participants were faced with a long word (for example: EXPERIMENT). 
  Then, participants had to find new words within this word, with a minimum of 4 letters (for example: ITEM).
  This looked like this:
  <br>
  <img src="{{ static 'Instructions/verbal_task.png' }}" class="left" width="60%" height= "auto"/>

  <br><br>
  Score: the maximum score participants get on this task is 10, the minimum is 0. 

  <br><br>
  <u>What is asked form you?</u><br>
  In every round you'll see two participants who both played these tasks twice.
  But, you can only see the first time the participants played the tasks. 
  <b>Your job is to indicate who of the two participants played better on the second time playing.</b>
  <br><br>
  But, take into account the possibility of the task being chosen:
  <p type = "text" id ="treatmenttext"></p>
  
  Every time you pick the correct participant, you'll receive a payment of â‚¬0.50.

  So, if the math task was picked in randomisation and the participant you chose scored better on the second time performing the tasks, 
  you'll receive your payment.

  <input type="hidden" name="treatment" id="treatment"/>
