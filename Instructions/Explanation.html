  On the next page you will see the scores of two participants on two tasks, a mathematical task and a verbal task.
  These tasks are played twice by several participants. But you will only see the scores of the first round. 
  Your job is to then indicate which one of the two participants will perform better on the second round, according to your beliefs.
  After the experiment, one of the two tasks will be randomly chosen. <p type = "text">The chance that the math task is chosen is 50%, the chance that the verbal task is chosen is 50%.</p>

  If the participant you chose performed better on the second round than the other participant on the randomly chosen task, you'll receive a potential payment of €0.50.
  You will also be faced with some demographics of the participants. 
  Hover your mouse over the buttons to reveal the information you want to know. 
  <br><br>
  
  <u>For example:</u> participant 1 has a score of 8 (out of 10) in round 1 on the math task and 7 (out of 10) in round 1 on the verbal task. 
  Participant 2 has a score of 8 (out of 10) in round 1 on the math task and 8 (out of 10) in round 1 on the verbal task.
  What you will then see is (obviously when you hover your mouse over a button): <br>
  <img src="{{ static 'Instructions/example.png' }}" class="left" width="30%" height="auto" />

  <br><br>
  What you will not know are the scores of round 2. Participant 1 scored <b>7</b> on the math task and <b>8</b> on the verbal task in round 2.
  Participant 2 scored <b>8</b> on the math task and <b>7</b> on the verbal task in round 2. <br><br>
  
  <b>With only the information of round 1, who do you expect to perform better on round 2?</b><br>
  If you choose participant 1 and the math task is selected, you will not receive payment (because in round 2, participant 2 performs better). 
  But if the verbal task is selected, you'll receive a payment of €0.50 (because participant 1 outperformed participant 2 in round 2).
  <br><br>
  In total, there are 40 trials, so the potential payment is €20. To be in with a chance of receiving any potential payment, please provide us with your email address on the last page of the experiment. 
  The tasks participants played were as follows:
  <br><br>

  <u>Mathematical task</u><br>
  Participants were faced with a matrix of 12 numbers. They had to find which numbers summed up to 10. 
  When they were correct, they saw the next matrix. See an example below:
  <br>
  <img src="{{ static 'Instructions/math_task.png' }}" class="left" width="30%" height="auto"/>

  <br><br>
  Score: the maximum score participants get on this task is 10, the minimum is 0. 


  <br><br>
  <u>Verbal task</u><br>
  For this task, participants were faced with a long word (for example: ASCRIBING). 
  Then, participants had to find new words using the letters of the long word, with a minimum of 4 letters (for example: ITEM).
  See an example below:
  <br>
  <img src="{{ static 'Instructions/verbal_task.png' }}" class="left" width="60%" height= "auto"/>

  <br><br>
  Score: the maximum score participants get on this task is 10, the minimum is 0. 

  <input type="hidden" name="treatment" id="treatment"/>

  function getRandomInt(min, max) {
    min = Math.ceil(min);
    max = Math.floor(max);

  }

  let treatmentnumber = getRandomInt(1,4);
  console.log(treatmentnumber);

  if (treatmentnumber == 1) {
    // document.getElementById("treatmenttext").innerHTML = "The chance that the math task is chosen is 25%, the chance that the verbal task is chosen is 75%.";
